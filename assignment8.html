            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Final project week! The assignment was to implement the <a href="assignment7.html">project plan from last week</a> and create something which combined multiple fabrication techniques taught throughout the quarter. The project statement was the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Design and digitally fabricate an object of your choosing using at least four of the techniques you have learned in class. It can be any kind of object with any kind of intended audience, but it must follow the plan you presented in proposal week.</i>
            </p>
            <h2>Concept Review</h2>
            <p>
                My chosen final project was to construct an octopus with a 3D printed head and a mechanical iris body that would sprout legs when the iris was opened. Time permitting, I wanted to add a light feature to the base so that the head would light up when the iris was open. The project used the following techniques learned in this class:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Laser cutting (octopus body/mechanical iris)</li>
                <li>CAD (designing the octopus head in Rhino and mechanical iris in OnShape)</li>
                <li>3D printing (octopus head)</li>
                <li>Moving/interlocking/stock parts (mechanical iris)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I included the following brainstorming sketches in my project proposal. They are copied here to show the first parts of my process for this project.

            <h2>The Digital Part</h2>
            <p>
                I began the project by building the octopus head in Rhino. I quickly created a sphere and a circle extruded along a curve. I merged the two together and had a basic shape from the head. The base had a radius of 3" because I knew my final project would be approximately that size and I planned to resize later if necessary.
            </p>
            <img src="a8/img1.png" width=400>
            <br/>
            <p>
                My initial plan was to apply a Voronoi pattern to the surface of the head. Unfortunately, a search for a generator online did not yield any results that worked without additional script downloads. I wanted to keep things fairly simple so I thought about trying to apply a more generic geometric pattern to the surface of the head. I played around with a hexagon pattern generated via Grasshopper but I couldn't cleanly trim the pattern from the head.
            </p>
            <img src="a8/img2.png" width=400>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Rather than spend a dangerously long amount of time on a relatively small part of the project, I decided to cut my losses and move forward with an unpatterned head. I transitioned to OnShape to begin the mechanical iris design. I wanted to create an 8-bladed iris in which the blades would protrude from the ring when open. Before designing anything in digital form, I looked at a lot of examples. Most irises had 5 blades which did not protrude from the sides when opened. After a lot more research and sketching, I started to understand the various components of the iris. I also tried to plan the number of layers I would need for the finished iris. I knew that I would need two layers of wood to stabilize the dowels, a single layer with the dowel rotation track, two layers for the blades (one with the dowel track and one fully intact), and a final layer for the screws on top.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I had a mental model of the layers and components involved in the iris, I purchased the wood screws which would need to go through 4 layers of 6mm plywood (~1" long). I couldn't find any metal dowel pins at Home Depot so I started designing with the intention of finding a dowel-shaped object later in the process. I also found some 3" diameter puck lights at Home Depot and bought them with the ambitious goal of incorporating light into the final design.
            </p>

            <br/>
            <p>
                I created all of the layers in OnShape, making liberal use of extrusion and rotation. I made holes the size of my wood screws and dowel holes/tracks with 1/4" diameter. The blades of the iris were roughly traced using the curve of the circle as a guideline. Once all of the layers were designed, I put them together in an assembly to ensure that the rotation would work properly and everything would fit together. I was confident about the latter but not sold on the former.

            <br/>
            <p>
                Despite a few uncertainties about how all the blades would open and close, I decided to cut out the piece and test a few of the blades. I exported all of the layers as DXFs and arranged them into a single SVG file in Illustrator.
            </p>
            <img src="a8/img8.png" width=400>
            <br/>
            <h2>The Fabrication Part</h2>
            <p>
                Despite my best attempts to correctly scale things in Illustrator, I ended up with an inch->millimeter mismatch somewhere along the way. The first iteration of my laser cut iris (100 power, 10 speed, 6mm plywood) was too small. Luckily, this was an adorable prototyping size and I was able to find some stock parts which helped me prototype the complete assembly. I used some leftover stained wood from a previous project so everything looked very sleek.
            </p>
            <img src="a8/img9.jpg" width=400>
            <br/>
            <img src="a8/img10.jpg" width=400>
            <br/>
            <p>
                I quickly realized that 8 blades with a 3" diameter would not allow me to open the iris as much as I wanted. I did a bit of math and realized that 6 blades yield a much more elegant mechanism. Since the final product would still be a cephalopod, I decided to modify my design.
            </p>
            <img src="a8/img11.jpg" width=400>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Thankfully, most of my OnShape layers were quite easy to change. I had to change the number of times all of the holes and tracks were patterned. I also had to modify the shape of the blades. After these simple adjustments, I had a much improved final product.
            </p>
            <img src="a8/img11a.png" width=400>
            <br/>
            <p>
                I cut the new layers out of the same piece of stained wood, this time at the correct scale.

            <br/>
            <p>
                My screws fit perfectly but I still needed to find some kind of dowel to fit in the track. I purchased a 1/4" craft wooden dowel from Amazon that I could cut into 16mm pieces.
            </p>
            <img src="a8/img14.jpg" width=400>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, I cut the rest of the iris blades and began 3D printing the octopus head. The print took ~6 hours to complete on a Prusa i3 MK3 printer with a 0.020 quality print. At this time, I used wood glue to combine the two bottom layers and each of the two layers on the iris blades.

            <br/>
            <p>
                The dowels arrived from Amazon and I cut them to size with the help of a saw and clamp. I tried the mechanism and found that it was sticking a lot due to a combination of friction and the angle of the track I had designed. I didn't have time to re-cut the blades with a more aggressively angled track. I tried to reduce the friction problem by using various grains of sandpaper on the sides of the blades, dowel track, dowels, and the surfaces of the layers that needed to rotate against one another.
            </p>
            <img src="a8/img19.jpg" width=400>
            <br/>
            <p>
                The final product was a mechanism that worked fairly smoothly after some help opening a few of the blades. The light fit into the base quite well and all of the blades combined such that no light shone through when they were closed. The head lit up when the iris was open, successfully creating a luminescent octopus.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                <u>What went well?</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                I was quite happy with the outcome of this project. The final octopus is visually clean and well-made. I was even able to include a light! The iris was challenging for me to visualize but I spent a lot of time sketching out all of the parts and looking at other examples. All of this time paid off in a big way since the design of the iris was less labor-intensive than expected. I had to make minimal modifications to the design after prototyping and was able to stick to my timeline. When necessary, I sacrificed several smaller aspects of my design to create a more complete finished product and avoid deviating from the timeline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, this project follows the best practices that were taught in class. The files are documented and the parts are dimensioned. I measured everything multiple times and ensured that all parts would work together before starting the physical fabrication phase.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>What could have gone better?</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                The final outcome diverges from the proposal in two features. The head is not patterned because the extra time spent in design would have thrown off the timeline of the project, possibly impacting the core functionality. It also ended up being a squid because of recalculations explained above. One of these deviations was made in the interest of time and the other was made in the interest of the quality of the final product. From the outset, I knew that this project was ambitiously scoped, something I have worked to improve all quarter. I wanted to be more ambitious for the final and thought that this was the correct mix of challenging but reasonable within the time span. Aside from the Voronoi, I believe I achieved this. Had I not been in the middle of a move, I believe I would have had enough extra time and motivation to complete all parts of the project as intended.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>What would I do differently next time?</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                A fun challenge in a future implementation of this project would be to parameterize the iris. It would be great to enter a number of legs or a size dimension and auto-generate a new iris. That would require a lot more work and some hard limitations on the range of allowed inputs. I would also change the material of the iris. I think that the final iris looks very elegant because of the stained wood and metal. However, a 3D printed octopus would theoretically have less friction which could lead to a smoother mechanism. Finally, I would cut the grooves on each leg at a more extreme angle so that the open/close mechanism of the iris would be more forceful.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Final thoughts</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                This project felt like a fun culmination of things I learned across the quarter. I found this octopus to be an enjoyable challenge and I am quite happy with what I achieved over the span of the project. Thank you for joining me on my octopus-themed journey into the world of digital fabrication!
