            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Final project week! The assignment was to implement the <a href="assignment7.html">project plan from last week</a> and create something which combined multiple fabrication techniques taught throughout the quarter. The project statement was the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Design and digitally fabricate an object of your choosing using at least four of the techniques you have learned in class. It can be any kind of object with any kind of intended audience, but it must follow the plan you presented in proposal week.</i>
            </p>
            <h2>Concept Review</h2>
            <p>
                My chosen final project was to construct an octopus with a 3D printed head and a mechanical iris body that would sprout legs when the iris was opened. Time permitting, I wanted to add a light feature to the base so that the head would light up when the iris was open. The project used the following techniques learned in this class:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Laser cutting (octopus body/mechanical iris)</li>
                <li>CAD (designing the octopus head in Rhino and mechanical iris in OnShape)</li>
                <li>3D printing (octopus head)</li>
                <li>Moving/interlocking/stock parts (mechanical iris)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I included the following brainstorming sketches in my project proposal. They are copied here to show the first parts of my process for this project.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                <u>What went well</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                I was quite happy with the outcome of this project. The final octopus is visually clean and well-made. I was even able to include a light! The iris was challenging for me to visualize but I spent a lot of time sketching out all of the parts and looking at other examples. All of this time paid off in a big way since the design of the iris was less labor-intensive than expected. I had to make minimal modifications to the design after prototyping and was able to stick to my timeline. When necessary, I sacrificed several smaller aspects of my design to create a more complete finished product and avoid deviating from the timeline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, this project follows the best practices that were taught in class. The files are documented and the parts are dimensioned. I measured everything multiple times and ensured that all parts would work together before starting the physical fabrication phase.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>What could have gone better</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                The final outcome diverges from the proposal in two features. The head is not patterned because the extra time spent in design would have thrown off the timeline of the project, possibly impacting the core functionality. It also ended up being a squid because of recalculations explained above. One of these deviations was made in the interest of time and the other was made in the interest of the quality of the final product. From the outset, I knew that this project was ambitiously scoped, something I have worked to improve all quarter. I wanted to be more ambitious for the final and thought that this was the correct mix of challenging but reasonable within the time span. Aside from the Voronoi, I believe I achieved this. Had I not been in the middle of a move, I believe I would have had enough extra time and motivation to complete all parts of the project as intended.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>What would I do differently next time?</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                A fun challenge in a future implementation of this project would be to parameterize the iris. It would be great to enter a number of legs or a size dimension and auto-generate a new iris. That would require a lot more work and some hard limitations on the range of allowed inputs. I would also change the material of the iris. I think that the final iris looks very elegant because of the stained wood and metal. However, a 3D printed octopus would theoretically have less friction which could lead to a smoother mechanism. Finally, I would cut the grooves on each leg at a more extreme angle so that the open/close mechanism of the iris would be more forceful.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Final thoughts</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                This project felt like a fun culmination of things I learned across the quarter. I found this octopus to be an enjoyable challenge and I am quite happy with what I achieved over the span of the project. Thank you for joining me on my octopus-themed journey into the world of digital fabrication!
