                My name is Emma! I'm a part-time HCDE masters student. When I'm not learning about HCDE, I work as a software engineer at Google. I like writing and solving puzzles, exploring Seattle (even though I've lived here for most of my life), reading, and all things related to food/drink. I love using my creativity to create physical objects. Digital fabrication is the perfect blend of problem solving, physical construction, and self-expression. I have past experience in laser cutting and some long-forgotten training in a machine shop. I hope to learn both software and hardware skills to follow through on any creative ideas that may pass through my brain. I also hope to get a solid knowledge foundation in the subject and have a certain level of comfort with most tools in a standard makerspace. I'm happy to teach my peers anything related to Github and frontend engineering.
